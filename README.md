# Malimg
Malimg dataset consists of 9,339 malware samples from 25 different malware families. Nataraj et al. (2011)[1] created the Malimg dataset by reading malware binaries into an 8-bit unsigned integer composing a matrix M ∈ R^{m×n}. The said matrix may be visualized as a grayscale image having values in the range of [0, 255], with 0 representing black and 1 representing white.
